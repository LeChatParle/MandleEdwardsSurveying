            <h3>ALTA/ACSM Surveys</h3>
            <p>(American Land Title Association/American Congress on Surveying and Mapping) Usually referred to as ALTA Surveys, these surveys
        	are usually more commonly performed on commercial and industrial properties. They determine property lines, locate substantial visible improvements,
            and typically identify and show, utilities, parking spaces, building dimensions, information on identifying adjoining property, property zoning
            information and
        	flood zones as listed on the “Table A” options from the ALTA requirements. An ALTA Survey is usually performed in coordination with the issuance of a
            Title Insurance Policy on the property by a Title Insurance Company and requires easements and other restrictions contained with in the title
            commitment to be addressed on the survey. An ALTA Survey is a very comprehensive survey.</p>

            <h3>CAD</h3>
            <p>CAD stands for Computer Aided Drafting. In short it is the use of a computer and software to accurately draw objects to scale and
        	print copies of the drawing. It is used to design/draw detailed two- or three-dimensional objects, such as mechanical parts or buildings.
            Mandle-Edwards Surveying, Inc. uses CAD to prepare its survey plats.</p>

        	adjustment of the Canadian-Mexican-U.S. leveling observations. It held fixed the height of the primary tidal bench mark, referenced to the new
        	International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 local mean sea level height value, at Father Point/Rimouski, Quebec, Canada. Additional tidal bench mark
            elevations were not used due to the demonstrated variations in sea surface topography, i.e., the fact that mean sea level is not the same equipotential 			surface at all tidal bench marks.

Topographic maps are used by a wide variety of people, such as surveyors laying out a new road; backpackers finding their way into remote
            areas; scientists describing soil or vegetation types, wildlife habitat, or hydrology and military personnel planning field operation</p>

            <h3>CD</h3>
            <p>This stands for Cairo Datum and was originally based on a benchmark at an Army Corps of Engineers facility in Cairo Illinois. In
        	1879 an elevation survey was conducted down the Mississippi River from Cairo to New Orleans. The elevation of the Cairo benchmark was arbitrarly raised 			to ensure there would be no negative elevations in the New Orleans area. The difference between the elevation from Cairo and the Mean Sea Level at the
            time was found to be 20.43 feet. The Cairo Datum currently used in the New Orleans area is just an artificial means for keeping the elevations
            positive, hence making mathematic calculations easier.</p>

        	title to the underlying land is retained by the original owner for all other purposes. Typical easements are for access to another property (often
			redundantly stated "access and egress," since entry exit are over the same path), for utility or sewer lines both under above ground, use of spring
            water, to make repairs on a fence slide area, drive cattle across other uses.</p>

        	the life of a 30-year mortgage. These zones have a Base Flood Elevation that is the minimum elevation to which FEMA requires new construction be built. 			Local governments may require a higher minimum elevation for new construction.</p>

            sea level at the 26 tide gauges and by the set of elevations of all bench marks resulting from the adjustment. A total of 106,724 km of leveling was

            <p>Commonly called a Topo Survey, this type of survey is frequently used by Architects, Engineers and Developers for the design and
       		development of property. Typically a Topo Survey will show the boundaries, buildings, improvements, known easements, encroachments as well as any
        	significant natural features on a property. Surface elevations on a specified interval, elevations along the perimeter of pavement and elevations on
            sewer and drainage features with the inverted elevations of and the size of the sewer and drain pipes are a frequent component of a Topo Survey.</p>
