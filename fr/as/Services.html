            <h3>ALTA/ACSM Surveys</h3>
            <p>Usually referred to as ALTA Surveys, these surveys are usually more commonly performed on commercial and industrial properties. They determine
            property lines, locate substantial visible improvements, and typically identify and show, utilities, parking spaces, building dimensions, information
            on identifying adjoining property, property zoning information and flood zones as listed on the “Table A” options from the ALTA requirements. An ALTA
            Survey is usually performed in coordination with the issuance of a Title Insurance Policy on the property by a Title Insurance Company and requires
            easements and other restrictions contained with in the title commitment to be addressed on the survey. An ALTA Survey is a very comprehensive survey.

            <h3>Accident Site Surveys</h3>
            <p>Surveys showing the relief features or surface configuration and other details of the area surrounding an accident. We provide complete Survey site
            scenes and produce a display and mapping exhibits for settlement or litigation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C1LP">
            <h3>Construction Layouts</h3>
            <p>These plan for the construction of buildings, roadways, and utilities. It is the translation of construction plans into physical points being marked
            on the ground to be used as a basis for the actual construction. A Construction Layout may be as simple as staking four points on a residential lot to
            start construction of a building, may include staking of piling locations or be as complex as staking multiple points for horizontal and vertical
            control on larger projects. Almost any roadway, building, or other man-made structure has had some amount of construction layout involved.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C1LP">
            <h3>Mortgage Survey</h3>
            <p>These surveys are typically used by title companies and mortgage lenders to obtain proof that the major improvements on the property are free of
            encroachments onto neighboring properties or into recorded easements. Mortgage surveys do not establish property corners or property lines and may not
            be used for building purposes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C1LP">
            <h3>Condominium Surveys</h3>
            <p>These surveys consist of the typical Boundary Line Survey with the added element of a three dimensional survey of the perimeter of each unit of the
            condominium. A detail of the elevation view of the building(s), parking, areas which are common (Common Element) to the complex and areas which are
            limited (Limited Common Element) to the use of a specific unit are shown on the survey. Interior unit walls not affecting the perimeter of the units
            may also be requested.</p>

            <h3>Benchmark Elevation Surveys</h3>
            <p>Surveys which measure the elevation of the ground, buildings (if any) and the adjoining street on a property for construction purposes. A temporary
            Benchmark is set at or near the property as a reference during construction to assist in determining how high to build a structure. Typically a
            Benchmark Elevation Survey is needed for a permit for new construction, significant remodeling or renovation work and for raising an existing building.
            Orleans Parish is currently the only local government that has it own standardized Benchmark Certificate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C3RP">
            <h3>Flood Elevation Surveys</h3>
            <p>Surveys which measure the elevation of buildings, equipment servicing the building and the adjacent ground for purpose of determining cost of Flood
            Insurance. Typically the results of a Flood Elevation Survey are reported on a FEMA Elevation Certificate which is issued to the client. FEMA Elevation 			 			Certificates includes the required necessary data and Flood Insurance Rate Map information to allow Insurance Agents to issue a Flood Insurance Policy
            on a building.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C3RP">
            <h3>Hydrographic Surveys</h3>
            <p>Surveys determining the geometry and dynamic characteristics of bodies of water. These surveys collect data that may include the water depth, bottom 			  			contours and configuration, directions and velocity of current, heights and water stages, and the location of fixed objects for navigational, dredging,
            oil exploration/drilling and marine construction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C12MP">
            <h3>No Work Affidavits</h3>
            <p>An inspection is made by a surveyor of the property to determine that no work has started and that no materials have been delivered to the site. The 			  			inspection must take place on the same day that the No Work Affidavit Certificate is issued. No Work Affidavits are usually requested by a financial
            institution to help protect their financial interests in a property when a construction loan has been taken out on the property.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C3RP">
            <h3>Topographic Surveys</h3>
            <p>Commonly called a Topo Survey, this type of survey is frequently used by Architects, Engineers and Developers for the design and development of
            property. Typically a Topo Survey will show the boundaries, buildings, improvements, known easements, encroachments as well as any significant natural
            features on a property. Surface elevations on a specified interval, elevations along the perimeter of pavement and elevations on sewer and drainage
            features with the inverted elevations of and the size of the sewer and drain pipes are a frequent component of a Topo Survey.</p>

            <h3>Builder's Packages</h3>
            <p>The builder's package, also called Construction Packages, is designed to provide all of the necessary land surveys and elevation certificates needed for 			 local government permits for the construction of a new home or commercial building. A Builder's Package is more cost effective than if each of the
             elevations and surveys are ordered in a piecemeal manner. Actual requirements may vary from one local government to another and over time change.
             A Builders’ Package may be tailored to meet additional needs. In general, a basic Builders’ Package will include the following:
			<br />
			<br />
			<i>1st Trip</i>: Property line survey staking, where physically accessible, or referencing the corners of the property and issue survey plat.
            Elevation survey
            of property (includes construction benchmark) and issue certificate of construction benchmark.
            <br />
            <br />
			<i>2nd Trip</i>: Top of Forms/Pier survey and elevation prior to pouring slab or upon construction of piers. Issue survey plat showing
            perimeter location of
            forms/pier and issue Top of Forms/Piers elevation.
            <br />
            <br />
			<i>3rd Trip</i>: Slab(floor) survey and elevation after the slab has been poured or the floor has been added. Issue survey plat showing slab
            (floor) location
            and FEMA elevation certificate showing slab/floor elevation.
            <br />
            <br />
			<i>4th Trip</i>: As Built survey and elevation. Upon completion of building (when the building is ready to be moved into and all equipment is
            hooked up to the
            building), issue FEMA National Flood Insurance Program elevation certificate and issue survey plat showing improvements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C12MP">
            <h3>Boundary Surveys</h3>
            <p>These surveys, also called Property Line Surveys, meet the state standards for a property boundary survey and show the boundaries, buildings,
            improvements, known easements and encroachments on a property. They also establish the property corners. Boundary surveys are typically performed to
            obtain building permits, to resolve property line disputes, for erecting fences and etc.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C12MP">
            <h3>As-Built Surveys</h3>
            <p>Is most commonly the survey of the finished product for new construction. An As-Built Survey, like a
			boundary survey, shows the property boundaries, buildings, improvements, known easements and encroachments for a construction project which has been
            completed. seldom corresponds exactly to the original plans in every detail. The purpose of an As-Built Survey is to record these variations.
            Sometimes, reproductions of the original drawings are used with variations recorded by crossing out the original design data and writing in the
            As-Built data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="C12MP">
            <h3>Subdivision Surveys</h3>
            <p>These are Boundary Surveys that commonly adjust the location of one or more property lines. A Subdivision Survey is used to legally subdivide
            property. These surveys may be a simple as combining two 25 foot wide lots into one new 50 foot wide lot, dividing a 100 foot wide lot into two new 50
            foot wide lots or as complex as creating numerous lots and streets from parcel of land consisting of many acres.</p>
